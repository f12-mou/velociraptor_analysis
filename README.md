# velociraptor_analysis
This is a part of course Security Sessional. Here we were given a digital forensic tool named velociraptor which we had to examine and describe the code base and features in details. The code base here is a part of analysis of the features. The live video link will be attached here for further understanding. 


To run the codebase for custom artifacts and post-analysis, you may clone the repo:
```markdown
git clone https://github.com/f12-mou/velociraptor_analysis.git
